Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HTML] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [CSS] - awesome web-based text editor
- [Java Script] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
